# go-proxy

A simple **reverse proxy** written in Go using `httputil.ReverseProxy`.  

It forwards incoming HTTP requests to a backend server and streams responses efficiently.  

## Current Features

- Reverse proxy to a single backend URL (`http://localhost:8000`)
- Connection pooling with configurable idle connections
- Error handling for backend failures
- Response streaming with configurable flush interval

## Requirements

- Go 1.20+ (or latest stable)
- A backend server to proxy requests to (e.g., `localhost:8000`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thashreef45/go-proxy.git
cd go-proxy
